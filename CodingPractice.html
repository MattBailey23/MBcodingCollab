		<h2>MB Coding Projects</h2>
		<p>A combination of a few coding projects I have worked on can be found in the Projects Menu</p>
		<h3>API Projects</h3>
		<p>The API section in the project nav currently only has my weather data project. It is a simple call an
			api and handle the JSON data returned. It currently takes the user entered city and puts the data needed
			into a table dynamically.</p>
		</p>I also have a social media project I am working on where you can log in with facebook, twitter, or instagram
			and post to those sites from one place. However since I am only working on a local host it will not work from
			other computers so it has been removed from the site.</p>
		<h3>Games</h3>
		<p>Farkle is a dice game to where you roll dice to attempt to get 10,000 Points exactly. The current status of this
			project isn't quite visually appealing, but there is a lot of logic to put into so my focus has been on that currently.
			for the most part all of the logic is there I just need to add a few more things to work out rarer use cases.</p>
		<p>War is the card game everyone knows how to play. Again this isn't very visually appealing at the moment and I would
			like to add some better effects to the card handling but the logic is all there on this one. Just need to add some CSS work</p>
		<p>The Pokemon Battle Simulater is one I created a while ago to begin brushing up on my coding. You select the 2 Pokemon
			you would like to battle and it shows which moves the Pokemon know. I used a Random Number simulator to randomize
			which attacks the pokemon will use each round. Every move has a different damage amount and the number of rounds varies
			depending on how much damage all the attacks do combined compared to the opponents health. Looking at in now there
			is a lot more I would like to do to this one logic wise and visually.</p>
		<h3>The Zelda Project</h3>
		<p>I am a big Zelda fan and there is several games that have been made over the years and I thought it would be a good
			idea to create a site where you can track your progress throughout all of the games. I like to complete ever side mission
			and collect every item there is. Instead of going through one game in different sites I want to combine them all together
			to create a one stop shop. There is a lot of work still to do on this but what is there gives the general idea. I would
			also like to add a Merchandise section to track all the zelda collectables out there.</p>
