            <p>Hello! decided to make the war card game for you guys to play but it is still a work in progress so here is what to expect right now. War is a long game, but as of right now I do not have logic for when either you or the computer has 0 cards left so technically you can't win right now sorry! Also if there is a tie in card value, the logic right now is you will get one more card that won't be able to tie again. if you win the tie  you will also only get 2 cards insted of 4 I haven't added logic for the "hidden" cards yet. Other than that try it out and I'm welcome to feedback. Enjoy!</p>

            <p>P.S. sorry that it isn't very visually appealing</p>
